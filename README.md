### What I learned

In this challenge i've learned to make a hover effect, using transitions and overlay images:

/*HOVER EFFECT*/
.fade {
    position: relative;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
  }
  
  .image {
    opacity: 1;
    display: block;
    transition: .5s ease;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
  }
  
  .middle {
    position: absolute;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    width: 17rem;
    height: 17rem;
    background-color: rgba(0, 255, 247, 0.5);
    border-radius: .5rem;
    transition: .5s ease;
    opacity: 0;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
  }
  
  .fade:hover .image {
    opacity: 0.8;
  }

  .fade:active .image{
      opacity: 0.8;
  }
  
  .fade:hover .middle {
    opacity: 1;
  }

  .fade:active .middle{
      opacity: 1;
  }
  
  .eye {
    color: #ffff;
    padding: 16px 32px;
    background-color: none;
  }
